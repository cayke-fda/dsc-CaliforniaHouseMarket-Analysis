    "In this project we analyze data from the California House Market competition from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/california-house-prices/overview). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, we are given a dataset with data containing a house's specifications (number of bedrooms, bathrooms, lot size, appliances, address...) and we build different regression models that predict its market price. If you are looking to buy a house, having a software that can show if a price is too high (bad deal) or too low (great deal) can save you some money or help you negotiate its value. If you are willing to sell your house, tho, knowing its price can help filter bad offers out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is very disorganized at first. Several columns are actually redundant (like \"Cooling\" and \"Cooling Features\"), others are not filtered (number of bedrooms has several string entries) and a lot of missing data. The datasets are already divided into training and test set already, where the training set is used to fit models and tune their hyperparameters and the test set does not contain a target value. This is because, the test set must be submitted to the Kaggle Compeitition and the score is generated after. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main metric for this problem is the log RMSE: the Root Mean Squared Error between the log of the predicted value and the log of the true value. This is an important metric because of the different orders of magnitude we are dealing with. In this metric the error between predicting that a $\\$100,000$ house actually costs $\\$1,000,000$ is the same as predicting that a $\\$1,000,000$ house costs $\\$10,000,000$ which is one order of magnitude. However, because several models unfortunately still predict a negative price, we mainly use the normal RMSE to tune hyperparameters and choose our models. We still try to calculate log RMSE when possible and use it to choose our best model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first conduct an exploratory data analysis, clean the data and drop features that are redundant or not needed. We then build a pipeline that imputes missing data, one hot encodes left categorical data and standardized numerica data. Each model we test is coupled to this pipeline so we are able to have a pipeline ready for deployment in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best model is the XGBoost, with an log RMSE of 0.32, being closely followed by Random Forest (0.33) and GradientBoosting (0.35). We propose future steps and conclude our work."

    "Buying a house is an important transition in a person's live. Besides being an important change between paying rent to live to own one yourself, houses can also be used an investiments or colaterals for banks.

The real state market in the US is worth over 50 trillion dollars. It is one of the most important industries as everybody needs housing and their prices only go up with time.\n",
